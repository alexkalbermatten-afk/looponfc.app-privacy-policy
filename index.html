    <h2>1. Scope of This Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Android application "LoopO NFC" (hereafter "the App"), developed and published by Alex Kalbermatten (hereafter "the Developer").</p>

    <p>The App requires the following permissions to function:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>All permissions are used solely for the App's core functionality. No background data collection occurs.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Contacting the Developer</h2>

        <li>You are not required to contact the Developer to use the App.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, advertising networks, or social media platforms.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since no data leaves your device, your information remains secure on your personal device. We recommend you maintain standard device security practices.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <p>The Developer reserves the right to update this privacy policy. The updated version will be indicated by a revised "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
